# üèè IPL 2025 Batting Intent Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive **Batting Intent Analysis** of a high-stakes IPL 2025 match between **Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB)** and **Delhi Capitals (DC)**. Using detailed **ball-by-ball data** and powerful Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Plotly**, and **Seaborn**, we uncover batting patterns and performance trends that highlight how different players and teams approach various phases of the game.

## üîç Key Insights

### 1. Strike Rate Across Game Phases
Batters like **T Stubbs** and **KL Rahul** showed strong intent in the death overs with strike rates >220, while **PD Salt** impressed in the powerplay with over 140.
